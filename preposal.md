# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to make a 2048 type game possibly. (Except I would call it something else and do it with like 3s cause that sounds funny to me

Alternatively I can think of a lot of interesting/funny ways to adapt the game PONG to be different progressively so that is my backup
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I do not plan on collaborating

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Yeah 2048 type game is my ideal idea and I guess I am wondering if that sounds too easy? Or too hard? And also if you can think of a program or website that would be helpful in trying to create that game
