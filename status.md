Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
-I have made all the pieces for the game and begun attempting to code it
-Mainly I have just been watching YouTube trying to learn GDScript and how to actually even do anything in the program


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The grid does not work. And the pieces don't move. And the scoreboard and other things like that

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The main problem is that it is really hard to make 2048. I have run into so many problems trying to just use Godot and setup a functioning grid. I had to use someone's code to make the pixels function like a grid and vice verse. Honestly this project is really hard and that's my main problem
